Don't pick a hack which is in this folder unless you know what you're doing.

Hacks in this folder are notoriously bad and have a lot of weird design decisions or shitty level design. Sometimes it can be fun to play really bad hacks but like I don't want people picking them without knowing how bad they are.
Difficulty is usually higher as well, but its not the good and fun kind of difficulty, its just the collision kills or fucks with you so much that its inadvertently hard.
