This folder is for hard casual and/or light kaizo (whatever that means nowadays) hacks

Basically, hacks that are hard enough that I don't think casuals should pick them, but if you want a bit of a challenge or are experienced in sm64, but don't want to go to full-on kaizo, these hacks should be fine.

But like if you struggle with Star Road, these hacks might be too difficult for you.
