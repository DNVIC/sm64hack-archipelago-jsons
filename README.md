JSONs with Expert at the end of their name include all humanly-viable tricks (excluding star/key door skips) in logic. 

JSONs with Advanced at the end of their name include all humanly viable tricks, other than light chuckyas, HOLP strats, handsfree bobombs, and precise BLJs

If you've made a JSON file and want to share it here, either message @DNVIC on discord with the JSON file, or make a pull request, and I'll add it.
